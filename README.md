# 1R_ShipmentTracking
This repository contains information on the requirements and implementation of the ONE Record shipment tracking API. It is basis for the Air Cargo industry commitment on ONE Record, Level 1, which is presumably to be implemented in late 2023.

This README-file contains meta-information on the repository, while the requirements and implementation material can be found in the file

**1R_ShipmentTracking.md**

### Objective 

In 2022, major stakeholders of the supply chain decided to aim for a renewed data sharing infrastructure for the supply chain by 2026. This process was initiated and is moderated by the International Air Transportation Association (IATA). As a first step towards a holistics ONE Record-based eco-system, some parties agreed to implement an open shipment tracking API in 2023 (exact date tbd.). Thus, the purpose of this document is to provide a Good Practice for a shipment tracking API in the IATA ONE Record-based data eco-system for the supply chain. 

"Shipment" is defined as pieces under one contract, and not limited to the Master- or House-AWB. As ONE Record aims for multi-modality, this document should also find use in other modes of transportation beyond air freight only.

### Target audience
This document can be used by any party with the interest in the topic. 

### Geographical coverage
As there are no legal or operational restrictions, the solution can be used world wide.

### Creators
This document is the outcome of the work of the "Joint ONE Record piloting and transition working group // technical part" at IATA. It was orchestrated by Arnaud Lambert of IATA as Secretary, with Philipp Billion of Lufthansa Cargo as Chairman. 

Major contributions were made by:

* Lufthansa Cargo, Dr. Philipp Billion
* Lufthansa Industry Solutions, Dr. Daniel A. DÃ¶ppner
* Air Canada, Josh Priebe
* Riege Software, Martin Skopp
* IATA, Arnaud Lambert
* DHL, Mary Stradling
* Air France / KLM, Bilel Chakroun
* GLS HKG, Keith Lam
* Nexshore Technologies, Pramod Rao
* British Telecom, Mark Belliss
* Qatar Airways, Ajay Manoharan
* Colog AG, Matthias Hurst
* MDF Solutions, Martin Fowler

A special thanks to Niclas Scheiber, Frankfurt University of applied sciences for preparing version 3.0 of the business ontology of ONE Record in coordination with the IATA ONE Record data model focus group.

### Continous development and availability

This document is to be used and continously developed, even if the current major stakeholders should move to other topics. Thus a "handover" of this document in Github is planned if responsibilities should shift.

### Use and reference

This Good Practice is free to access and use. If you use it, please refer to this document explicitly plus provide a link to the Github repository as source. This will ensure know-how-transfer and transparency.
